      }
    },
    "qualityHygiene": {
      "question": "How do you ensure quality and hygiene?",
      "answer": "Every item goes through our rigorous quality inspection process. We clean, sanitize, and test all materials before delivery. Our team checks for functionality, safety, and cleanliness. Items that don't meet our standards are responsibly recycled instead."
    },
    "deliveryAreas": {
      "question": "What areas do you deliver to?",
      "answer": "We currently offer delivery services to major metropolitan areas and are rapidly expanding. Check our service area on the homepage or contact us to see if we deliver to your location. We're always looking to grow our network!"
    },
    "earnings": {
      "question": "How much can I earn from selling my old items?",
      "answer": "Earnings depend on the item's condition, demand, and market value. Our pricing algorithm considers these factors to give you a fair price. On average, sellers earn 60-80% of the item's assessed value, with payments processed within 48 hours of delivery confirmation."
    },
    "buyerCost": {
      "question": "Is there a cost for buyers?",
      "answer": "Buyers pay for the items plus a small service fee that covers quality inspection, cleaning, and delivery. Our prices are typically 40-70% less than buying new, making quality second-hand materials affordable while supporting sustainability."

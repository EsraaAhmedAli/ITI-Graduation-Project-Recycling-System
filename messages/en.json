    },
    "earnings": {
      "question": "How much can I earn from selling my old items?",
      "answer": "Earnings depend on the item's condition, demand, and market value. Our pricing algorithm considers these factors to give you a fair price. On average, sellers earn 60-80% of the item's assessed value, with payments processed within 48 hours of delivery confirmation."
    },
    "buyerCost": {
      "question": "Is there a cost for buyers?",
      "answer": "Buyers pay for the items plus a small service fee that covers quality inspection, cleaning, and delivery. Our prices are typically 40-70% less than buying new, making quality second-hand materials affordable while supporting sustainability."

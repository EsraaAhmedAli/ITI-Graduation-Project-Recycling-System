    },
    "buyerCost": {
      "question": "Is there a cost for buyers?",
      "answer": "Buyers pay for the items plus a small service fee that covers quality inspection, cleaning, and delivery. Our prices are typically 40-70% less than buying new, making quality second-hand materials affordable while supporting sustainability."
